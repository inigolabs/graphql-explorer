# GraphQL Explorer Component for React

This repository contains an open-source **GraphQL Explorer Component** for React, enabling developers to easily integrate an interactive GraphQL playground into their React applications.

## Features

The GraphQL Explorer is designed with developers in mind, offering features that simplify workflows and enhance productivity. Hereâ€™s what it includes:

- **Query Builder:** Construct complex GraphQL queries with an easy-to-use interface.
- **History:** Quickly access and reuse previous queries.
- **Saved Collections:** Keep your frequently used queries organized and ready.
- **Define Extension Headers:** Customize and add extension headers to your GraphQL requests for advanced use cases.
- **Share Queries:** Share queries with others, whether or not they include variables.
- **Multi-Tab Support:** Work on multiple queries simultaneously for better multitasking.
- **Run 10x Options:** Send multiple queries at once to test performance and scalability.
- **Response Viewer with Headers:** Debug effectively with detailed response and header insights.
- **Schema Viewer:** Navigate and explore your schema with a visual overview.
- **PreFlight Scripts:** Set up login or other pre-configurations before running queries.
- **Local Preferences**: Save and retrieve user preferences, such as layout and active tabs.

## Installation

Install the package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @inigolabs/graphql-explorer
```

or

```bash
yarn add @inigolabs/graphql-explorer
```

## Usage

Import the `Explorer` component and include it in your application. The `defaultState` prop is **required** to initialize the explorer.

```tsx
import "@inigolabs/graphql-explorer/styles";
import Explorer from "@inigolabs/graphql-explorer";

function App() {
  const defaultState = {};

  return (
    <div>
      <Explorer
        defaultState={defaultState}
        onStateChange={(state) => console.log("Explorer state updated:", state)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
